/**
 * The three-way light / dark / lynn switch, modeled on the plugin's own
 * `role="radiogroup"` theme toggle and built on `Tabs` so it inherits the
 * segmented-control styling rather than restating it.
 *
 * Changing the mode plays the plugin's own reveal: a circle grows out of the
 * segment you clicked until it covers the viewport, the tokens swap behind
 * it, and it fades off onto the new theme. The overlay it sweeps with is
 * appended to `document.body`, not rendered here - the whole page has to
 * wipe, including chrome portalled outside `ThemeProvider`'s own wrapper
 * div. See `themeWipe.ts` for the mechanism.
 *
 * Requires a `ThemeProvider` above it - without one there is no mode to
 * change, and the control renders inert on `lynn`.
 *
 * Usage: drop it in the `cta` slot of `Nav`, or in a page's own header, and
 * pass nothing else - it reads and writes the theme itself, so there is no
 * value or handler to wire. `showLabels={false}` gives the icon-only form;
 * each segment keeps its accessible name either way. Because it is a `Tabs`
 * with `semantics="radiogroup"`, arrow keys walk the three modes - and the
 * wipe then starts from the control's own center, since no one segment was
 * clicked. `animated={false}` drops the wipe for a toggle that only themes
 * an embedded preview.
 *
 * Don't: don't render it outside a `ThemeProvider` - `useLynnTheme`'s context
 * default reports `lynn` and drops every write, so the toggle looks
 * operational and changes nothing. And don't mount two of them expecting
 * independent scopes; both drive the same single provider, and the wipe is
 * document-level, so whichever one you click sweeps the same single page.
