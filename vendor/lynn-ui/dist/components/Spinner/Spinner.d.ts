 * The bordered-ring loading spinner, ported from the plugin's `.spinner`.

 * - `light` (the default) for Lynn's dark surfaces and inside a filled
 * `Button`, `dark` for a light panel, so the choice does not change when the
 * `ThemeToggle` moves. `size="sm"` is the 11px in-button size `Button.loading`
 * uses; `md` and `lg` are for a standalone loading state.
 *
 * Don't: don't leave the default `ariaLabel` on a spinner that already sits
 * inside a labeled loading region or a busy `Button` - you get "Loading"
 * announced twice; pass `ariaLabel={null}` to make it decorative, which is
 * exactly what `Button` and `AccessGate` do. And don't use it for work with a
 * known length: `ProgressBar` or `GaugeRing` tell the reader how much is left.
