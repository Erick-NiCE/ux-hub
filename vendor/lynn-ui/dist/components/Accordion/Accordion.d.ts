 * Usage: a layout wrapper and nothing more - it holds no state and passes no
 * context, so each `AccordionItem` owns its own open flag. Use it to get the
 * stacked spacing; a lone collapsible section works fine as a bare
 * `AccordionItem`.
 *

 * behavior - there is no mechanism here to close a sibling, and no prop will
 * give you one.

 * The behavior is a port of the plugin's `DevSection`
 * (`src/ui/dev-section.tsx`): a chevron that rotates 90 degrees when open, a
 * `hint` tooltip on the header, an `actions` slot outside the toggle, and a
 * `localStorage`-remembered open state - with the storage key derived from
 * `id` instead of being fixed to one product's namespace.
 *
 * The card chrome around it is faq.html's `.faq-item`, since that is the real
 * Lynn-side surface for this shape; the plugin's own section is unstyled
 * because it lives inside an already-framed panel.
 *
 * Usage: `id` is both the `aria-controls` target and the `localStorage` suffix,
 * so pick something stable and meaningful. Explain a section through `hint`
 * (a header tooltip) rather than a paragraph that costs vertical space
 * forever, and put any control - a `Button`, a `Badge`, a `Switch` - in
 * `actions`, which renders outside the toggle because a button cannot nest
 * inside a button. Set `persist={false}` for equal-weight lists such as a
 * plain FAQ, where a remembered open row is noise rather than a preference.
 *
 * Don't: don't rename a shipped section's `id` - the stored key moves with it,
 * so every existing reader silently loses their collapsed state. And don't
 * expect `defaultOpen` to keep applying once `persist` is on: it seeds the
 * first render only, and any stored value takes precedence from then on.
