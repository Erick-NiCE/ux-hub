/**
 * A real copy-to-clipboard button.
 *
 * The shape is the plugin's `btn-icon-label` clipboard button (a 13px
 * clipboard glyph beside a short verb), built on the real `Button`. The
 * confirmation goes through `useToast()`, so a `<ToastViewport />` has to be
 * mounted for anything to be seen - without one the copy still happens
 * silently.
 *
 * The clipboard API is unavailable outside a secure context and can be
 * refused by permission policy, so the failure path reports rather than
 * throwing into the void.
 *
 * Usage: give it the exact string to copy in `text` and a verb in `label`
 * ("Copy import", "Copy token"), and set `successMessage` to say what landed
 * on the clipboard rather than leaving the generic "Copied". `variant` is
 * passed straight through to `Button`; `CodeBlock` uses `ghost` for the one in
 * its header.
 *
 * Don't: don't use it on a page with no `ToastViewport` mounted - both the
 * success and the "could not copy" paths report only through `useToast()`, so
 * with no viewport a failed copy is indistinguishable from a successful one.
 * And don't hand it a live value that might change between render and click:
 * `text` is read at click time, but it is also what the clipboard gets
 * verbatim, with no trimming or formatting.
