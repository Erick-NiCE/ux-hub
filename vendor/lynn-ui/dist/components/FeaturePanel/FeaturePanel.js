/**
 * The large narrative walkthrough panel.
 *
 * Ported from wings-2026.html's `.walk-panel` family: a 24px-radius panel lit
 * by two opposite-corner radial glows over the `card` fill, a gradient stripe
 * along its top edge, then an uppercase pill, a heading, a body capped at
 * 620px, and a row of actions.
 *
 * Usage: one panel per step of a walkthrough, and let the `actions` row be the
 * hand-off - the first action defaults to `primary` and the rest to
 * `secondary`, so a two-action panel needs no `variant` at all. `body` takes
 * markup for the source's bold clauses, and anything richer (a step list, a
 * figure, a nested `CodeBlock`) goes in `children`, which renders below the
 * actions. `accentGradient` re-tints only the 2px top stripe.
 *
 * Don't: don't try to put a custom control in `actions` - it is typed as
 * `FeaturePanelAction` data, not nodes, precisely so every action is
 * guaranteed to be a real `Button`; put anything else in `children`. And
 * `badge` is always rendered `tone="lynn"`, so don't pass a `Badge` of your
 * own expecting the tone to survive - pass the label text.
