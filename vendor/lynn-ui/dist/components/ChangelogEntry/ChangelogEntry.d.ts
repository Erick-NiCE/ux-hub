/**
 * One release on a changelog.
 *
 * Ported from release-notes.html's `.changelog-card` family, which has two
 * real forms: the newest release renders expanded, as a version sidebar
 * beside its grouped bullet lists; every older one renders as a toggle row
 * that expands the identical body. Both share `ChangelogBody`, so the two
 * forms cannot drift.
 *
 * The toggle row is a real `Button` at `ghost`, laid out as a full-width row -
 * and its chevron uses the same rotate-on-open treatment as `Accordion`.
 *
 * Usage: exactly one entry in a list carries `isLatest`, and it renders the
 * expanded no-toggle form with the LATEST pill; every other entry is a
 * collapsed toggle row. Give each card an `id` (`release-v11-4`) so a
 * `DocRail` link and a deep link both land on it - without one the collapsible
 * body still gets a generated `aria-controls` target, but the card itself has
 * no anchor. Keep `group.tone` to the three the source uses: `blue` for new
 * features, `coral` for fixes, `emerald` for improvements.
 *
 * Don't: don't pass `isLatest` and `defaultOpen` together - the `isLatest`
 * branch returns before the toggle is ever built, so `defaultOpen` is dead
 * code there. And don't drive `defaultOpen` from state to open a card later:
 * it is read once into `useState`, so it only means anything on the first
 * render (the playground re-keys the whole preview for exactly this reason).
