/**
 * `lynn/motion/sparkle`
 *
 * The default (no `children`) renders Tabler's `sparkles` glyph as three
 * separate diamonds - the same shapes the combined icon is built from, split
 * back into their own `<path>`s - each twinkling (scale + opacity, no
 * rotation) on its own staggered delay. A single rigid shape doesn't have
 * 4-fold symmetry, so rotating the whole glyph the way `nice-sparkle` did
 * read as a lopsided half-spin rather than a twinkle; three independently
 * pulsing layers is what actually looks like the glyph transforming.
 *
 * Usage: pass no children for the built-in three-layer glyph in the `lynn`
 * accent - use it beside a Superpowers label or a new-feature heading. It
 * renders `display: inline-flex`, so it sits in a line of text without
 * disturbing it. Self-disables under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`.
 *
 * Don't: don't wrap a button or any other control in it - it's `aria-hidden`
 * and built for a decorative inline glyph, not an interactive element; a
 * control inside would animate along with it and lose its own hover/focus
 * affordance. Site copy that wraps a real button's icon in this treatment is
 * a misuse of the component, not a supported pattern.
