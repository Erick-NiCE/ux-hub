 *
 * Don't: don't pass duplicate initials in `people` or `gates[].people` - the
 * avatars are keyed by the initials string, so two people who share initials
 * collide on one React key and only one disc renders. And don't pass
 * `statusVariant` without `status`: the footer badge only renders when there is
 * a label, so the variant alone does nothing.
