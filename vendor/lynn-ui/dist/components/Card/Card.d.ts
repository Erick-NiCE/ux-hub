/**
 * A Lynn surface card.

 * border, `lg` radius, hover lift, tilt and spotlight.
 *
 * Usage: pass `interactive` only where the card has mouse-move room - the
 * 7-degree tilt and the 220px spotlight need travel to read as depth, and look
 * wrong on cards packed edge-to-edge in a dense grid or nested inside another
 * interactive surface. Turn it off (`interactive={false}`) for a static
 * container, which is what every card on the playground page does. `accent`
 * draws the 2px top strip; `blue`, `indigo` and `teal` render two-stop
 * gradients and the other four render solid.
 *
 * Don't: don't set `liquid` on a `solid` card - the drifting highlight is
 * layered into the translucent pane, so the class is only applied when
 * `variant="glass"` and otherwise does nothing at all. And don't treat
 * `onClick` as making the card a button: this renders a plain `div` with no
 * role, no `tabIndex` and no key handling, so a clickable card is unreachable
 * by keyboard - put a real `Button` or link inside it instead.
