/**
 * `lynn/motion/glow-pulse`
 *
 * A breathing purple/blue box-shadow halo around its children, ported from
 * `nice-effects.css`'s `.nice-glow-pulse` (3s ease-in-out infinite).
 *
 * Usage: one instance per screen, around the single element you want the eye
 * pulled to - a live `Badge`, a primary CTA, the one card that changed. There
 * are no props beyond `className` / `style` on purpose: the halo is a fixed
 * lynn-and-blue pair so it always reads as the same signal.
 *
 * Don't: don't apply it to several siblings at once - the halo is a 34px and
 * 60px box-shadow pair, so adjacent glows overlap into a single lit region
 * and the "look here" meaning is gone. And the halo's own corners are fixed
 * at `--lynn-radius-pill` to match its two documented targets - wrapping a
 * square-cornered surface (a `Card`, most buttons) shows the mismatch as a
 * rounded halo behind straight corners; override `border-radius` through
 * `className` there.
